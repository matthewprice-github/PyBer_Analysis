# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this assignment was to gather several months worth of rideshare data across several city types, synthesize the data, and visualize the results to help contextualize the data. These visuals and data summaries will better inform Pyber's decisionmaking process as the company progresses into the year. 

## Results 
The Pyber Summary data table can be found [here](https://github.com/matthewprice-github/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Pyber_fare_summary.png). 

Urban cities predictably have the highest voume of rides, drivers, and fares. This makes sense given urban cities have higher population densities, and residents are less likely to have cars of their own compared to rural and suburban city types. However, rural towns have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. This means that while demand is low in rural areas, supply of drivers is even lower, which causes prices to increase. The opposite effect is happening for the urban cities, where total drivers is actually outnumbering total rides, which makes ridesharing prices lower. 

Looking at [total fares by city type](https://github.com/matthewprice-github/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Pyber_fare_summary.png), we can see that each city type's weekly fare total falls within a certain range. Rural city types have weekly revenue in the $0-500 range, while suburban and urban city types fall in the $750-1250 and $1750-2250 ranges, respectively. 

## Summary 
Looking at the disparities in city types, there are a few recommendations we can make. The first would be to address the oversupply of drivers in the urban cities. At it's current state, there were more drivers in urban cities than rides given during this time period. That means some drivers did not give a single ride during this time. Perhaps offer a bonus or financial incentive for drivers to move out to the suburban and rural areas to pick up fares. 

Looking at weekly data in total fare by city type, we can see an interesting thing happened the week of 2-24 where total fares increased across all city types. IT would be interesting to know what happened during that week across the business to know if anthing was done differently that could have created a positive impact.

My final reccomendation pertains to getting more data. One unkown in this data set is we do not know the average distance driven for each ride, or average time durationg of the ride. Do rural city types have higher average fares because of the low supply of drivers? Or are typical rides just longer distances? How does time and duration of rides factor into fare price? If a driver has to drive far away to pick up/drop off a fare, it could take longer for them to drive back to a city center and pick up another ride. These could be factors affecting fare price that we are not seeing.
